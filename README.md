## Description

The programs in this repository are designed for use with NodeMCU, an open-source IoT platform based on the ESP8266 WiFi module. Each program is tailored to interact with different sensors, such as water level monitors, PIR sensors, raindrop sensors, soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors (DHT11), and ultrasonic sensors.

## Folder Structure

- `model/water_level_monitor`: Program for monitoring water levels using a sensor.
- `pir_sensor`: Program for utilizing a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor for motion detection.
- `rain_drop_sensor`: Program for detecting raindrops using a sensor.
- `soil_sensor`: Program for measuring soil moisture levels using a sensor.
- `temp_humidity_dht11`: Program for measuring temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor.
- `temp_lm35`: Program for measuring temperature using an LM35 sensor.
- `ultrasonic_sensor`: Program for measuring distance using an ultrasonic sensor.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the repository.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

You can use these programs to interface NodeMCU with various sensors and build IoT applications. Simply upload the appropriate program to your NodeMCU board using the Arduino IDE or another compatible development environment.
